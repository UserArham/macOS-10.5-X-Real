This an simulator of macOS 10.5 X by NanoTech Code.

This provided secure mode was designed for artifical effects which will give you a "SICK!!!" moment.
This is made using TXT, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The .gitgnore is the Android one.
MacOS has some features that are not AI in 10.5, but I am using something in 10.7 and AI features.

The map is very huge, maybe something I will just say, and it is easy!
